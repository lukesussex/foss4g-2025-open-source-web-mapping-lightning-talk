# FOSS4G 2025 — Fast, Free, and (Mostly) Painless: Open-Source Web Mapping Examples

This repo contains minimal examples to get you started with Leaflet, MapLibre and OpenLayers. For each map library there is a "basic" example showing adding a single point to the map, and another example showing multiple points.

Each example is an HTML file that includes all dependencies from a content delivery network (CDN), so no install or setup is required: just double-click the example to view it in your browser.

These were presented in a 5-minute lightning talk at FOSS4G 2025 in Auckland, New Zealand.

## Quick Start

- Either clone this repository or use GitHub tools to download the ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your computer.
- No build or install required. Just double-click the example to view it in your browser.
