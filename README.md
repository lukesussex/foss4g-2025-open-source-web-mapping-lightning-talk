# FOSS4G 2025 — Fast, Free, and (Mostly) Painless: Open-Source Web Mapping Examples

This repo contains minimal CDN-based examples for getting started with Leaflet, MapLibre and OpenLayers.

These were presented in a 5-minute lightning talk at FOSS4G 2025 in Auckland, New Zealand.

## Quick Start

No build or install required. Just open the examples in a browser:

- Leaflet: `examples/leaflet-basic.html`
- OpenLayers: `examples/openlayers-basic.html`
- MapLibre: `examples/maplibre-basic.html`
