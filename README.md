# README

This repo contains minimal examples to get you started with Leaflet, MapLibre and OpenLayers. For each map library there is a "basic" example showing adding a single point to the map, and another example showing multiple points.

Each example is an HTML file that includes all dependencies from a content delivery network (CDN), so no install or setup is required: just double-click the example to view it in your browser.

These were presented in a 5-minute lightning talk at FOSS4G 2025 in Auckland, New Zealand.

## Examples

- [Leaflet Example](leaflet.html) - Basic map with a single marker
