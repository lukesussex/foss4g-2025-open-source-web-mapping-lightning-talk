# Fast, Free, and (Mostly) Painless - Getting Started with Open-Source Web Mapping

This repo contains three minimal examples to get you started with Leaflet, MapLibre and OpenLayers. For each map library there is a basic example showing a map with a single marker.

Each example is an HTML file that includes all dependencies from a content delivery network (CDN), so no install or setup is required: just double-click the example to view it in your browser.

These were presented in a 5-minute lightning talk at FOSS4G 2025 in Auckland, New Zealand.

## Quick Start

- If viewing the examples on GitHub Pages, just click each example link below to view it in your browser.
- If you want to view the examples locally, either clone this repository or use GitHub tools to download the ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your computer. No build or install required. Just double-click the example to view it in your browser.
